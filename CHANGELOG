0.1.1:  Major refactor, changes to how it handles enums and codes to enable easier development and use
        So far non-breaking, things may have broken without me noticing, but quick testing shows no problems with pre-existing examples

        split __init__.py into multiple components using facade inheritance:

            __init__.py : entry point with setuptools data    

            main.py : main class with builtins, extended with modules loaded from setattr

            modules/ : classes that extend main class
                boardconn.py : most important board connection-related functions
                msp_ctrl.py : raw MSP protocol functions
                process.py : looong list of MSP specific message handling functions
                fast_functions.py : simplified wrappers for specific message types
                utils.py : some dict and socket functions used through the code
               
            enums/ : files with dicts of code value enums mapped to a string
                inav_enums.py : INAV enums parsed from source
                msp_codes.py : MSP message codes
                msp_vars.py : Long list of variables used in the main MSPy class

            tools/ : some tools, some for testing and will be integrated into a main class later

0.1.0:  YAMSPy fork, mostly exploration of how it works and some utilities to interact with INAV
